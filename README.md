Trade Booking Dependency Injection

This project demonstrates a simplied trade booking system with a central trade processing class where classes 
related to trade reporting, confirmation and saving the trade to a repository are injected.

The main advantage of Dependency Injection within projects is,

1) the fact that a class can be injected and configured externally increases reusability.

2) the number of dependencies in a project is reduced and the 'single reposibility principal' can be adhered to easier.

3) Testing through Mock or similar processes makes unit testing possible on large scale projects.
